                <h2>What is Prakriti?</h2>
                <p>Prakriti, a fundamental concept in Ayurveda, refers to your innate nature and constitution. It encompasses your physical, mental, and emotional characteristics, as well as your preferences, tendencies, and susceptibilities. By recognizing and understanding your prakriti, you can make informed choices in all aspects of life, from diet and exercise to stress management and career decisions.</p>
            </section>
            
            <h2>Uses of Determining Prakriti</h2>
            <p>Understanding one's Prakriti has several important uses in Ayurveda:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Healthcare:</strong> Once an individual's Prakriti is identified, Ayurvedic doctors can provide personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, daily routines, and stress management.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Understanding one's Prakriti can help in identifying potential imbalances and susceptibilities to specific diseases. Ayurvedic interventions can be designed to prevent imbalances from manifesting as illnesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment Planning:</strong> In case of illness or imbalance, Ayurvedic treatments and therapies are tailored to an individual's Prakriti.</li>
                <li><strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> Ayurvedic doctors consider the whole person—body, mind, and spirit—when addressing health concerns. Prakriti assessment plays a central role in this holistic approach.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>How Ayurvedic Doctors Use Prakriti</h2>
            <p>Ayurvedic doctors use Prakriti as a foundation for diagnosis and treatment. They consider the individual's Prakriti when prescribing herbal remedies, dietary guidelines, and lifestyle modifications. The goal is to restore balance and harmony to the doshas, promoting overall health and well-being.</p>
